# SimControlLab

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of dynamic system models and control strategies developed using MATLAB and Simulink. The models cover a range of mechanical, electrical, and electromechanical systems, including DC motors, position control systems, and signal flow diagrams.

The project is aimed at showcasing practical modeling skills in **control engineering**, with an emphasis on system dynamics, simulation, and controller design using tools such as **state-space representation**, **PID control**, and **PS-Simulink interfacing**.

## Use Case

The goal of this project is to bridge classical control theory with modern simulation tools. It's part of a broader effort to maintain fluency in **mechatronics** and **system dynamics**, especially while pursuing advanced work in **AI**.

This serves both as a personal learning lab and a portfolio artifact when applying for roles involving control systems, robotics, or automation engineering.

## Topics Covered

- Dynamic modeling of physical systems
- Electrical system simulation (DC motors, RLC circuits)
- Mechanical system modeling (mass-spring-damper)
- Control system design (PID, State-space)
- PS-Simulink interfacing
- Transfer function analysis and feedback loop modeling
